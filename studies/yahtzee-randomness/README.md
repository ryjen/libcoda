# Yahtzee randomness study

Issue #22 is Seamwork's first end-to-end refinement study.

It takes one useful seam from the historical C++ Yahtzee/libcoda code and rebuilds it deliberately in C++23 rather than porting the old utility library.

## Historical baseline

The old design had useful intent: inject a random engine so game tests could control rolls.

Its shape was roughly:

```text
player
  -> dice
      -> die
          -> raw die::engine*
              -> virtual generate(from, to)
```

The implementation also carried several unrelated properties:

- each die retained a raw engine pointer with implicit lifetime;
- the default engine was global/static;
- invalid construction used `throw new invalid_argument`;
- `die::roll()` asserted that the engine pointer was valid;
- a mutable `sides(value)` setter could bypass the constructor invariant;
- Yahtzee-specific code lived inside the nominally generic dice library.

Those are baseline observations, not requirements to preserve.

## Scope

This study keeps only the behavior needed to exercise the seam:

- five six-sided values form a valid Yahtzee hand;
- a first roll produces all five values;
- dice can be held;
- a reroll asks the source only for unheld dice;
- production randomness is backed by standard C++ random facilities;
- tests can provide exact semantic face sequences.

Scoring, networking, terminal UI, persistence, and the broad generic dice API are intentionally out of scope.

## Selected design

The primary variant uses:

- a small `face` domain enum;
- a value-semantic `hand`;
- a C++20/23 concept describing a semantic `face_source`;
- caller-owned source lifetime through a reference;
- a `uniform_face_source` adapter around any standard URBG.

The study also compiles runtime-interface, type-erased, and direct-URBG alternatives so the recommendation is based on concrete shapes rather than a straw-man comparison.

See [QART](qart.md) for the decision.

## Build

From the repository root:

```bash
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
ctest --preset dev -R seamwork_yahtzee_randomness
```

The example target is `seamwork_yahtzee_randomness_example`.

## Promotion status

**Study only.**

Nothing here is yet a general Seamwork component. The point is to validate the refinement workflow and a real consumer-facing seam first.
