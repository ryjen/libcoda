**Modern C++23 through interface and architecture refinement.**

Seamwork is a practical laboratory for exploring how modern C++ can produce interfaces that are expressive, maintainable, difficult to misuse, and explicit about ownership, lifetime, cost, and failure.

The project began as `libcoda`, a C++ utility toolkit used to learn modern C++ and experiment with cleaner APIs. The re-charter keeps that interest in interface quality while dropping the goal of being a general-purpose utility library.

Reusable components may emerge from the work, but the primary artifacts are the design studies, practical consumers, tests, measurements, and documented trade-offs that justify them.

## Project direction

Seamwork focuses on:

- interface refinement;
- C++23 language and standard-library facilities used deliberately;
- clean architectural boundaries without ceremony;
- pragmatic SOLID principles;
- explicit ownership, lifetime, error, and resource semantics;
- realistic examples rather than syntax-only demonstrations;
- testing, static analysis, sanitizers, fuzzing, and benchmarks as design evidence;
- comparing alternatives instead of assuming one C++ idiom is universally best.

See:

- [Project charter](docs/charter.md)
- [Design principles](docs/principles.md)
- [Refinement workflow](docs/refinement-workflow.md)
- [Re-charter and migration plan](docs/migration/seamwork-rebrand.md)

## Architecture

The existing architecture work remains useful as migration guidance:

- [System context](docs/architecture/0001-system-context.md)
- [Layered architecture and SOLID guidance](docs/architecture/0002-layered-architecture.md)
- [Error handling policy](docs/architecture/0003-error-handling.md)
- [Dependency policy](docs/architecture/0004-dependency-policy.md)
- [ADR 0002: transition toward a single Seamwork repository](docs/adr/0002-seamwork-topology.md)

Legacy `libcoda` components are migration inputs and archival evidence, not automatically endorsed Seamwork components.

## C++23 baseline

C++23 is the baseline for active Seamwork code.

The rule is:

> use the simplest mechanism that preserves the desired semantics, and use C++23 where it makes the interface or architecture meaningfully better.

Legacy components retain their historical language requirements only inside the explicit compatibility build; changing them without a design purpose would be syntax-only modernization.

## Practical consumers

The original C++ Yahtzee implementation survives on the archived `ryjen/yahtsee` repository's `original` branch. It is used as historical baseline evidence, not imported wholesale.

A typical Seamwork study moves through:

```text
problem
  -> straightforward implementation
  -> identify friction / coupling / ambiguity
  -> compare alternatives
  -> refine with appropriate C++23 mechanisms
  -> test / analyze / benchmark
  -> validate with a real consumer
  -> optionally promote to a reusable component
```

Promotion is optional. Demonstrating why an abstraction should not exist is a valid result.

## Current studies

- [Yahtzee randomness seam](studies/yahtzee-randomness/README.md) — compares a semantic callable/concept, runtime interface, type erasure, and direct URBG dependency against a focused C++23 consumer.

Studies are evidence and design work first. They are not automatically promoted into reusable Seamwork components.

## Security

The existing security work remains part of the evidence base:

- [Project threat model and release-hardening checklist](docs/security/threat-model.md)
- [Legacy `libcoda-net` threat model](docs/security/libcoda-net.md)
- [Legacy `libcoda-db` threat model](docs/security/libcoda-db.md)
- [Legacy `libcoda-format` threat model](docs/security/libcoda-format.md)

Security is treated as part of interface design: trust boundaries, input validation, resource bounds, error behavior, and secret handling should be explicit in the contract.

## Building

The default build is intentionally small and does not require the archived libcoda submodules:

```bash
nix develop
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
ctest --preset dev
```

Required CI runs this Seamwork-native path with GCC and Clang through the checked-in flake.

The historical libcoda aggregate remains available explicitly:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
nix develop .#legacy
cmake --preset legacy-dev
cmake --build --preset legacy-dev
```

See [`docs/build.md`](docs/build.md) for build boundaries and options.

## Lineage

Seamwork preserves the Git history and lessons of `libcoda`.

The eventual repository rename will happen after the active code surface reflects the new purpose. This avoids turning a repository rename into an implicit claim that every legacy utility is already part of the new design.
